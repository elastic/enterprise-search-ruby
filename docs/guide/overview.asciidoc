== Overview

This is the official Ruby client for Elastic Enterprise Search.

[discrete]
=== Compatibility

Current development happens in the main branch.

The library is compatible with all Elastic Enterprise Search versions since `7.x` but you **have to use a matching major version**:

* For **Elastic Enterprise Search 7.0** and later, use the major version 7 (`7.x.y`) of the library.
* For **Elastic Enterprise Search 8.0** and later, use the major version 8 (`8.x.y`) of the library.

=== HTTP Library

This library uses https://github.com/elastic/elastic-transport-ruby[elastic-transport], the low-level Ruby client for connecting to an Elastic cluster - also used in the official https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-ruby[Elasticsearch Ruby Client]. It uses https://rubygems.org/gems/faraday[Faraday], which supports several https://lostisland.github.io/faraday/adapters/[adapters] and will use `Net::HTTP` by default. For optimal performance with the Enterprise Search API, we suggest using an HTTP library which supports persistent ("keep-alive") connections. For the standard Ruby implementation, this could be https://github.com/drbrain/net-http-persistent[Net::HTTP::Persistent], https://github.com/toland/patron[patron] or https://github.com/typhoeus/typhoeus[Typhoeus]. For JRuby, https://github.com/cheald/manticore[Manticore] is a great option as well. Require the library for the adapter in your code and then pass in the `:adapter` parameter to the client when you initialize it:

[source,ruby]
---------------------------------------------------
require 'elastic-enterprise-search'
require 'faraday/net_http_persistent'

client = Elastic::EnterpriseSearch::Client.new(adapter: :net_http_persistent)
---------------------------------------------------

All requests, if successful, will return an `Elastic::Transport::Transport::Response` instance. You can access the response `body`, `headers` and `status`.

`elastic-transport` defines a https://github.com/elastic/elastic-transport-ruby/blob/main/lib/elastic/transport/transport/errors.rb[number of exception classes] for various client and server errors, as well as unsuccessful HTTP responses, making it possible to rescue specific exceptions with desired granularity. More details https://github.com/elastic/elastic-transport-ruby#exception-handling[here]. You can find the full documentation for `elastic-transport` at https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/ruby-api/current/transport.html[our official documentation] and  https://rubydoc.info/gems/elastic-transport[RubyDoc].

The clients pass different options to transport, you can check them out https://rubydoc.info/github/elastic/enterprise-search-ruby/Elastic/EnterpriseSearch/Client[on RubyDocs].

==== Setting the host and port

If you don't specify a host and port, the client will default to `http://localhost:3002`. Otherwise pass in the `:host` parameter as a String.

=== Logging

You can enable logging with the default logger by passing `log: true` as a parameter to the client's initializer. You can also pass in a Logger object with the `:logger` parameter, any confoming logger implementation will work:

[source,rb]
----------------------------
logger = MyLogger.new
client = Elastic::EnterpriseSearch::Client.new(logger: logger)
----------------------------

To trace requests and responses in the _Curl_ format, set the `trace` argument:

[source,rb]
----------------------------
> client = Elastic::EnterpriseSearch::Client.new(trace: true)
> client.health

   @body=                                                                                                                                                                                                          
    {"name"=>"5b8067bf95fb",
    ...
----------------------------

This will use the `elastic-transport` default logger. But you can pass in a custom logger with:

[source,rb]
----------------------------
client = Elastic::EnterpriseSearch::Client.new(tracer: my_tracer)
----------------------------
