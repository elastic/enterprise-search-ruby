==== Changes to Elasticsearch Search in App Search

[CAUTION]
====
The Elasticsearch search API for App Search is a beta feature. Beta features are subject to change and are not covered by the support SLA of generally available (GA) features. Elastic plans to promote this feature to GA in a future release.
====

The Elasticsearch Search API `search_es_search` has been updated to be more consistent with the Elasticsearch `_search` API.

In the previous version, a `request` object was required in the request:

[source,rb]
----------------------------
# DEPRECATED - This worked for 8.3 but has been updated in 8.4:
es_request = { body: { query: { bool: { must: { term: { title: 'test' } } } } } }
client.search_es_search(engine_name, body: { request: es_request })
----------------------------

This has been simplified to:

[source,rb]
----------------------------
es_request = { query: { bool: { must: { term: { title: 'test' } } } } }
client.search_es_search(engine_name, body: es_request)
----------------------------
