Official Ruby API client for [Elastic Enterprise Search](https://www.elastic.co/enterprise-search). Use this gem to integrate App Search and Workplace Search into your Ruby code.

## Installation

Install the `elastic-enterprise-search` gem from [Rubygems](https://rubygems.org/gems/elastic-enterprise-search):

```
$ gem install elastic-enterprise-search
```

Or add it to your project's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'elastic-enterprise-search', 'VERSION'
```

The Enterprise Search client is implemented with [`elastic-transport`](https://github.com/elastic/elastic-transport-ruby/) as the HTTP layer, which uses [Faraday](https://rubygems.org/gems/faraday). Faraday supports several [adapters](https://lostisland.github.io/faraday/adapters/) and will use `Net::HTTP` by default. For optimal performance with the Enterprise Search API, we suggest using an HTTP library which supports persistent ("keep-alive") connections. For the standard Ruby implementation, this could be https://github.com/drbrain/net-http-persistent[Net::HTTP::Persistent], [patron](https://github.com/toland/patron) or [Typhoeus](https://github.com/typhoeus/typhoeus). For JRuby, [Manticore](https://github.com/cheald/manticore) is a great option as well. Require the library for the adapter in your code and then pass in the `:adapter` parameter to the client when you initialize it:

```ruby
require 'elastic-enterprise-search'
require 'faraday/net_http_persistent'

client = Elastic::EnterpriseSearch::Client.new(adapter: :net_http_persistent)
```
If an adapter is not specified, the client will try to auto-detect available libraries and use the best available HTTP client.
